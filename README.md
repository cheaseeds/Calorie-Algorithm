#Calorie Algorithm

This course project is made to use a greedy and exhaustive algorithm to get a subset of foods from a .csv file and compare their efficiencies by analyzing their scatterplots and big Oh efficiencies. 

Attached with this is the food.csv and scatterplot files used to test the algorithms.
